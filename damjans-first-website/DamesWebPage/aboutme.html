       <div>I am Damjan Georgievski, born on 5th of September, 1994.
    Happily married to the most beautiful woman in the world (Anastasija) and father to 2 wonderful boys (Petar & Dimitar). My hobbies are playing video games (which is a rare occurrence these days) and playing rugby union for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skopjewildboars/" target="_blank"> Skopje Wild Boars.</a>
Ever since I was little, I knew I wanted to work with computers. 
Back when I was 10 years old, I was designing business cards in CorelDraw (I think it was CD11th version) and I could easly understand every bit of it in a short time.
As life went by, I started growing older and older, found myself in a dead-end job I had no desire working at. That's when I knew it was time for change.
Now here I am, learning Front End, Python, and some other stuff so I could get into the world of Web Development.
